When you first left me
I was wanting more
But you were ***king that girl next door
What'cha do that for?
What'cha do that for?

When you first left me
I didnt know what to say
I've never been on my own that way
Just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found the light in the tunnel at the end

Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you are feeling alone

At first when I see you cry
It makes me smile
Yeah it makes me smile

At worst I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me
You say that you want me back
(Want me back)
And I tell you it don't mean jack
(It don't mean jack)
No it don't mean jack
(No it don't mean jack)

I couldn't stop laughing
No I just couldn't help myself
See you messed up my mental health
I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found the light in the tunnel at the end

Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry
It makes me smile
Yeah it makes me smile

At worst I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile
La la la

At first when I see you cry
(When I see you cry)
It makes me smile
(It makes me smile)
Yeah it makes me smile
(Yeah it makes me smile)

At worst I feel bad for a while
(I feel bad for a while)
But then I just smile
(But then I just smile)
I go ahead and smile
(I go ahead and smile)
La la la

At first when I see you cry
(When I see you cry)
It makes me smile
(It makes me smile)
Yeah it makes me smile
(It makes me smile)

At worst I feel bad for a while
(I feel bad for a while)
But then I just smile
(Then I just smile)
I go ahead and smile
(I go ahead and smile)
